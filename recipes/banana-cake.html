    <h1>Banana cake</h1>
    <img src="../img/banana-cake.jpg" alt="Picture of banana-cake">

    <p>This banana cake recipe uses fresh mashed bananas and buttermilk for super moist 
       results. It was made for me by a friend while I was visiting her after she had
       delivered her 11th child. I told her, "I should have baked for you!" </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups mashed bananas</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 ⅛ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs/li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan.</li>
        <li>Make cake: Mix mashed bananas with lemon juice in a small bowl. Mix flour, 
            baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Cream sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes.
            Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Beat in flour mixture alternately 
            with buttermilk. Stir in banana mixture. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake 
            comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove cake from the oven and place it directly into 
            the freezer for 45 minutes. This will make the cake very moist.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make frosting: Cream butter and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in vanilla.
            Add confectioners sugar and beat on low speed until combined, then on high until 
            frosting is smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread frosting on cooled cake.</li>
    </ol>
