    <h1>Swedish meatballs</h1>
    <img src="../img/sweedish-meatballs.jpg" alt="Picture of swedish-meatballs">

    <p>This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition. We frequently double 
    the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker. </p>

    <p>Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even 
    better the next day! Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the 
    leftovers.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
        <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until crumbs 
            absorb cream, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir 
            onion until light brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a mixing bowl.</li>
    </ol>
